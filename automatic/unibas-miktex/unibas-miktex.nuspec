    <summary>An implementation of TeX/LaTeX</summary>
    <description><![CDATA[MiKTeX (pronounced mick-tech) is an up-to-date implementation of TeX/LaTeX and related programs. [TeX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TeX) is a typesetting system written by [Donald Ervin Knuth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Knuth) who says that it is intended for the creation of beautiful books - and especially for books that contain a lot of mathematics.

MiKTeX comes with TeXworks, a TeX frontend which you can use it to edit and preview LaTeX documents.

The sky is the limit when it comes to TeX/LaTeX, with drawings, chemical equations, syntax trees, circuit diagrams, mathematical expressions, proof systems, chessboards and more! ([Image source](https://mathvault.ca/latex-guide))

MiKTeX's integrated package manager installs missing [components](https://miktex.org/packages) from the Internet, if required.

## Package Set Parameter (optional)

* `/Set:(option)` - Download and install the `essential`, `basic` (default), or `complete` set of TeX packages/tools.

## Custom Repository Parameter (optional)

This package has only the MiKTeX setup utility embedded.  Any new install of MiKTeX involves using the setup utility to download and create a (temporary by default) repository and then installing from that repository.  This Chocolatey package can both establish a more permenant repository (for sharing with other computers) and use a specific (possibly private) repository from which to install MiKTeX.  Thus a single computer within a network could download MiKTeX from the internet and create a repository, and all other computers on the network could use that repository to install MiKTeX saving external bandwidth.

#### Using a Custom Repository:
* `/RepoPath:(path)` - with a share or URL as `(path)`.  This will install or update MiKTeX from a specific existing repository.  No attempt to update the repository itself will be made.  Upgrades **should** use this repository in the future by default.

#### Creating a Custom Repository:
* `/RepoPath:(path)` - with a local directory as `(path)`.  This will create (or update) the repository in the (non-temporary) location.  MiKTeX will also be installed.  **Note:** The repository will not be shared or accessible through a URL without additional administrator actions and will not be removed on an uninstall.

#### Examples:

`choco install miktek.install --params '"/Set:complete /RepoPath:""c:\Shared Files\MiKTeX-Repo"""'`
*Double-double quotes (i.e. `""path""`) are necessary for paths containing a space.*

`choco install miktek.install --params '"/RepoPath:https://localserver.org/MiKTeX-Repo"'`
