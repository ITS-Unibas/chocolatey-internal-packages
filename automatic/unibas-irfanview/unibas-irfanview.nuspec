    <description>It is designed to be simple for beginners and powerful for
      professionals. IrfanView seeks to create unique, new and interesting
      features, unlike some other graphic viewers, whose whole "creativity" is
      based on feature cloning, stealing of ideas and whole dialogs from ACDSee
      and/or IrfanView! (for example: XnView has been stealing/cloning features
      and whole dialogs from IrfanView, for 10+ years). IrfanView was the first
      Windows graphic viewer worldwide with Multiple (animated) GIF support. One
      of the first graphic viewers worldwide with Multipage TIF support. The first
      graphic viewer worldwide with Multiple ICO support.
