      VeraCrypt is a source-available freeware utility used for on-the-fly
      encryption (OTFE). It can create a virtual encrypted disk within a file
      or encrypt a partition or (in Windows) the entire storage device with
      pre-boot authentication.

      VeraCrypt is a fork of the discontinued TrueCrypt project. It was initially
      released on 22 June 2013 and produced its latest release (version 1.24) on 6
      October 2019. Many security improvements have been implemented and issues
      raised by TrueCrypt code audits have been fixed. VeraCrypt includes optimized
      implementations of cryptographic hash functions and ciphers which boost
      performance on modern CPUs.
